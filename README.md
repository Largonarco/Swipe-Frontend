# Swipe Frontend Assignment

Hi, I am Omkar Narayankar, and this is my solution to the assignment for the role of Frontend Developer Intern at Swipe. Regarding my solution, it is entirely functional and satisfies all the given requirements. As required, I built an intuitive Bulk Edit feature within the provided invoice management system. To use the feature, the user must click the Bulk Edit button on the Invoice List screen, select the invoices to edit, and confirm the selections. On confirming the selections, the user gets redirected to another page where they can edit the invoices in an Excel-like table and submit once done. I also rearranged files relating to Redux in a separate folder named "redux" for simplicity.
